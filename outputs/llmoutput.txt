The knockout of TIM3 in NK cells can lead to the downregulation of certain genes through several interconnected pathways, despite the absence of direct data in the provided CSV. TIM3, also known as HAVCR2, is a critical immune checkpoint receptor that modulates immune responses. Its absence can disrupt the balance of activating and inhibitory signals in NK cells, leading to altered gene expression profiles. One potential mechanism involves the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. TIM3 knockout may impair the activation of this pathway, as TIM3 has been shown to interact with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (Huang et al., 2015). This disruption can lead to the downregulation of genes involved in cell cycle progression and metabolic processes, such as CCND1 (Cyclin D1) and SLC2A1 (GLUT1), which are essential for NK cell function and energy metabolism.

Additionally, TIM3 knockout may influence the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which is pivotal for cytokine signaling and immune cell regulation. TIM3 has been implicated in modulating STAT3 activity (Gorman et al., 2017), and its absence could result in decreased STAT3 phosphorylation, leading to the downregulation of STAT3 target genes like BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL), which is involved in cell survival, and MYC, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the absence of TIM3 may enhance the activity of the NF-κB pathway, as TIM3 has been reported to negatively regulate NF-κB signaling (Lee et al., 2016). This could lead to a compensatory downregulation of genes that are typically suppressed by NF-κB, such as IL10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, and TNFAIP3 (A20), a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling.

Moreover, TIM3 knockout may affect the expression of genes involved in the cytotoxic function of NK cells. The absence of TIM3 can lead to altered expression of genes like GZMB (Granzyme B) and PRF1 (Perforin), which are crucial for the cytolytic activity of NK cells. This could be mediated through changes in the TGF-β signaling pathway, as TIM3 has been shown to interact with TGF-β receptors (Sakuishi et al., 2013), and its knockout may lead to enhanced TGF-β signaling, which is known to suppress NK cell cytotoxicity.

In summary, the knockout of TIM3 in NK cells can lead to the downregulation of specific genes through the disruption of key signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, JAK/STAT, and NF-κB, as well as through altered TGF-β signaling. These changes can impact cell survival, proliferation, metabolism, and cytotoxic function, providing a mechanistic insight into the gene expression alterations observed in TIM3-deficient NK cells.
