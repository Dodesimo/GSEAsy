# Introduction

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is a critical immune checkpoint receptor expressed on the surface of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by downregulating immune responses and promoting self-tolerance, thereby preventing autoimmune diseases (Keir et al., 2008). The blockade or knockout of PD-1 has been shown to enhance immune responses, which is the basis for its use in cancer immunotherapy (Topalian et al., 2012). In this study, we explore the effects of PD-1 knockout on gene expression in NK cells, focusing on the upregulation and downregulation of genes involved in immunological pathways. By analyzing the provided gene expression data, we aim to propose new mechanisms that explain these changes, with a particular emphasis on immunology-related pathways.

# Methods

The gene expression data provided in the CSV format was analyzed to identify pathways that are upregulated or downregulated in NK cells following PD-1 knockout. The analysis focused on pathways relevant to immunology, and specific genes within these pathways were examined for their roles and interactions. Literature was reviewed to support the proposed mechanisms, with citations provided in the text and a reference list at the end of the paper.

# Results

## Upregulated Pathways

### Cap-dependent Translation Initiation

The upregulation of the cap-dependent translation initiation pathway suggests an increase in protein synthesis in NK cells. This pathway involves several ribosomal proteins (e.g., RPL12, RPL36A) and eukaryotic initiation factors (e.g., EIF3E, EIF5) that are crucial for the initiation of mRNA translation (Sonenberg & Hinnebusch, 2009). The increased expression of these genes may enhance the production of proteins necessary for NK cell activation and function, potentially leading to a more robust immune response.

### Activation of BH3-only Proteins

The upregulation of BH3-only proteins, such as BCL2L11 (BIM) and BBC3 (PUMA), indicates an increase in pro-apoptotic signaling. These proteins are known to promote apoptosis by antagonizing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (Youle & Strasser, 2008). In the context of PD-1 knockout, this may reflect a mechanism by which NK cells regulate their survival and turnover, ensuring that only the most effective cells persist.

## Downregulated Pathways

### HIV Genome Transcription

The downregulation of genes involved in HIV genome transcription, such as POLR2E and TAF4, suggests a reduced capacity for viral replication. This may be a consequence of enhanced antiviral responses in NK cells, which are known to play a role in controlling viral infections (Vivier et al., 2011).

### Toll-like Receptor Signaling Pathway Regulation

The downregulation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, including genes like IRAK2 and TRAFD1, may indicate a shift in the immune response. TLRs are critical for recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiating innate immune responses (Kawai & Akira, 2010). The reduced expression of these genes could reflect a reprogramming of NK cell responses, potentially enhancing their cytotoxic activity while reducing inflammatory signaling.

# Discussion

The knockout of PD-1 in NK cells leads to significant changes in gene expression, particularly in pathways related to protein synthesis, apoptosis, and immune signaling. The upregulation of cap-dependent translation initiation and BH3-only proteins suggests an enhancement of NK cell activation and turnover, which may contribute to a more effective immune response. Conversely, the downregulation of pathways such as HIV genome transcription and TLR signaling indicates a potential reprogramming of NK cell functions, favoring antiviral and cytotoxic activities over inflammatory responses.

These findings align with previous studies demonstrating the role of PD-1 in modulating immune cell activity and suggest new mechanisms by which PD-1 knockout enhances NK cell function. Further research is needed to validate these mechanisms and explore their implications for immunotherapy and the treatment of infectious diseases.
