# Introduction

Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical components of the innate immune system, playing a pivotal role in the defense against tumors and virally infected cells. The regulation of NK cell activity is complex and involves various signaling pathways. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) is an inhibitory receptor that modulates immune responses, including those of NK cells. The combination of PD1 blockade with interleukin-21 (IL21) has been shown to enhance NK cell function, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aims to explore the differential gene expression in NK cells when treated with PD1 alone versus PD1 combined with IL21, focusing on the downregulation of specific genes. We hypothesize that the observed downregulation is mediated through alternative signaling pathways, which can be elucidated by examining the involvement of specific genes and their roles in other relevant pathways.

# Methods

## Data Collection

The gene expression data was obtained from a CSV file listing gene groups, their regulation status (upregulated or downregulated), and the corresponding genes. The focus was on pathways that were downregulated in the presence of PD1 and PD1 + IL21.

## Pathway Analysis

The pathways analyzed included:
1. Pertussis toxin-insensitive CCR5 signaling in macrophages
2. Oxidative stress-induced gene expression via Nrf2
3. Regulation of NFAT transcription factors
4. Interleukin-9 regulation of target genes
5. Interleukin-12/STAT4 pathway

Each pathway's lead genes were cross-referenced with existing literature to identify their roles in NK cell regulation and potential interactions with PD1 and IL21 signaling.

## Literature Review

A comprehensive literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar to identify studies that have investigated the roles of the lead genes in NK cell function and their potential involvement in PD1 and IL21 signaling pathways.

# Results

## Pertussis Toxin-Insensitive CCR5 Signaling

The CCR5 signaling pathway involves genes such as CALM2, CCR5, JUN, and FOS, which are known to play roles in immune cell migration and activation. The downregulation of this pathway in NK cells treated with PD1 + IL21 suggests a potential mechanism where IL21 modulates CCR5 expression, thereby affecting NK cell trafficking and function (Mack et al., 2011).

## Oxidative Stress-Induced Gene Expression via Nrf2

Genes such as JUN, FOS, and NFE2L2 are involved in the oxidative stress response. The downregulation of this pathway indicates that PD1 + IL21 may reduce oxidative stress in NK cells, potentially enhancing their cytotoxic function by maintaining cellular homeostasis (Kobayashi et al., 2016).

## Regulation of NFAT Transcription Factors

The NFAT pathway, involving genes like EGR1, JUN, and FOS, is crucial for the transcriptional activation of immune response genes. The downregulation observed suggests that PD1 + IL21 may suppress NFAT activity, thereby modulating NK cell activation and cytokine production (Macian, 2005).

## Interleukin-9 Regulation of Target Genes

The downregulation of genes such as CCL3 and SOCS3 in the IL-9 pathway indicates a potential reduction in inflammatory responses, which may be beneficial in preventing excessive immune activation and maintaining NK cell function (Stumhofer et al., 2007).

## Interleukin-12/STAT4 Pathway

The IL-12/STAT4 pathway, involving genes like STAT3, STAT4, and JUN, is critical for NK cell activation and proliferation. The downregulation of this pathway suggests that PD1 + IL21 may modulate STAT signaling, potentially enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity by preventing overstimulation (Thierfelder et al., 1996).

# Discussion

The differential downregulation of specific pathways in NK cells treated with PD1 versus PD1 + IL21 highlights the complex interplay between inhibitory and stimulatory signals in immune regulation. The downregulation of CCR5 signaling suggests a mechanism by which IL21 modulates NK cell migration, potentially enhancing their ability to target tumor cells. Similarly, the suppression of oxidative stress and NFAT pathways may contribute to improved NK cell function by maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing excessive activation.

The observed downregulation of the IL-9 and IL-12/STAT4 pathways further supports the notion that PD1 + IL21 modulates inflammatory responses and cytokine signaling, which could enhance NK cell cytotoxicity while preventing immune exhaustion. These findings align with previous studies that have demonstrated the synergistic effects of PD1 blockade and IL21 in enhancing NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses (Biron et al., 1999; Skak et al., 2008).

In conclusion, the downregulation of specific pathways in NK cells treated with PD1 + IL21 provides insights into the mechanisms by which this combination therapy enhances NK cell function. Further studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore their therapeutic potential in cancer immunotherapy.
