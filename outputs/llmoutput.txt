The knockout of TIM3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3) in NK cells has been shown to significantly impact various signaling pathways, leading to the downregulation of numerous genes. TIM3 is a known immune checkpoint receptor that plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses, including those mediated by NK cells. Its absence can disrupt normal signaling pathways, leading to altered gene expression profiles. In the context of the provided data, several pathways are notably downregulated, including the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, the mTOR signaling pathway, and the AKT signaling pathway, all of which are critical for NK cell function and survival.

The NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which includes genes such as NFKBIA, RELA, and IKBKB, is essential for the regulation of immune responses and cell survival. The downregulation of this pathway in TIM3 knockout NK cells could be attributed to the loss of TIM3-mediated signaling, which normally helps maintain NF-kappaB activity. This is supported by literature indicating that TIM3 can modulate NF-kappaB signaling, thereby influencing the expression of genes involved in inflammation and immune regulation (Anderson et al., 2016). The downregulation of NF-kappaB-related genes may lead to reduced inflammatory responses and impaired NK cell cytotoxicity.

Similarly, the mTOR signaling pathway, involving genes such as AKT1, PIK3R1, and EIF4E, is crucial for cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. TIM3 has been implicated in the regulation of mTOR signaling, and its knockout could lead to decreased mTOR activity, as evidenced by the downregulation of these genes. This aligns with findings that TIM3 can influence mTOR signaling pathways, affecting cellular metabolism and immune cell function (Huang et al., 2015). The reduced expression of mTOR pathway components may result in impaired NK cell metabolism and function, contributing to the observed gene expression profile.

The AKT signaling pathway, which includes genes like AKT1 and PIK3R1, is another critical pathway affected by TIM3 knockout. AKT signaling is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism, and its downregulation in the absence of TIM3 suggests a disruption in these processes. TIM3 has been shown to interact with PI3K/AKT pathways, influencing cell survival and function (Zhu et al., 2013). The downregulation of AKT pathway genes may lead to decreased NK cell survival and impaired immune responses.

Overall, the knockout of TIM3 in NK cells leads to the downregulation of key signaling pathways, including NF-kappaB, mTOR, and AKT, which are essential for NK cell function and survival. The specific downregulation of genes within these pathways highlights the critical role of TIM3 in maintaining normal NK cell activity and suggests potential mechanisms by which TIM3 influences immune responses. These findings are consistent with existing literature on the role of TIM3 in immune regulation and provide insights into the molecular consequences of its absence in NK cells.
