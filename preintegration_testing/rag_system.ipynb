Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine published by Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\\nSummary::\\nAcetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a major cause of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in many countries. Hepatocyte proliferation, autophagy and antioxidant capacity are crucial to the prognosis of APAP-induced liver injury, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we found that human antigen R (HuR) protein expression was markedly increased in the model of APAP-induced liver injury, and conditional hepatocyte-specific HuR knockout aggravated APAP-induced liver injury in mice. Further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of HuR's protective effects showed that conditional hepatocyte-specific HuR knockout reduced the protein expression of cyclin A1, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, CDK2, ATG3, ATG5, ATG7 and NRF2 in mice, reducing hepatocyte proliferation, autophagy and antioxidant capacity. Mechanistically, HuR could physically associate with the 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of cyclin A1, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, Cdk2, Atg3, Atg5, Atg7 and Nrf2 mRNAs, thereby regulating their translation. These findings suggest that HuR attenuates APAP-induced liver injury by regulating hepatocyte proliferation, autophagy and antioxidant capacity.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-10-29\\nTitle: {'i': ['IDO1', 'IDO2', 'TDO', 'KMO'], '#text': 'Gene Variant Frequencies of , , , and  in Substance Use Disorder Cohorts.'}\\nCopyright Information: \\nSummary::\\nBACKGROUND: Substance use disorder in the United States represents a complex and growing public health crisis, marked by increasing rates of overdose deaths and the misuse of prescription medications.

      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "Natural Killer (NK) cells are critical components of the innate immune system, known for their ability to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. The regulation of gene expression in NK cells is crucial for their function and is influenced by various stimuli, including immunoglobulin G (IgG) interactions. This study aims to explore the differential gene expression in NK cells under experimental conditions involving IgG, focusing on the immunological pathways that may contribute to the observed upregulation and downregulation of specific genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods**\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset provided includes gene expression data for NK cells under control and experimental IgG conditions. The analysis focused on genes with significant changes in expression, as indicated by log2 fold change and statistical significance (p-value). Genes with a log2 fold change greater than 0.5 and a p-value less than 0.05 were considered for further analysis. The identified genes were then mapped to known immunological pathways using databases such as KEGG and Reactome to propose potential mechanisms of regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results**\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis identified several genes with significant changes in expression. Notably, genes such as *Nfkbia*, *Ifitm1*, and *Ly6c2* were upregulated, while genes like *Bcl2* and *Gzmd* were downregulated. The upregulation of *Nfkbia* suggests activation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, which is known to play a role in immune responses and inflammation (Hayden & Ghosh, 2008). The increased expression of *Ifitm1* is indicative of enhanced antiviral responses, as this gene is associated with the restriction of viral replication (Bailey et al., 2014). The upregulation of *Ly6c2* may be linked to increased cell adhesion and migration, processes essential for NK cell function (Hogarth & Pietersz, 2012).\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the downregulation of *Bcl2* suggests a potential reduction in cell survival signaling, which could influence NK cell apoptosis (Cory & Adams, 2002). The decreased expression of *Gzmd* may reflect alterations in cytotoxic activity, as granzyme D is involved in inducing apoptosis in target cells (Chowdhury & Lieberman, 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Discussion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The differential expression of genes in NK cells under experimental IgG conditions highlights several immunological pathways that may be modulated. The upregulation of *Nfkbia* and *Ifitm1* suggests an enhanced immune response, potentially increasing the NK cells' ability to respond to viral infections. The involvement of the NF-ÎºB pathway is particularly significant, as it is a central regulator of immune responses and can be activated by various stimuli, including cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (Hayden & Ghosh, 2008).\n",
      "\n",
      "The downregulation of *Bcl2* and *Gzmd* may indicate a shift in the balance between NK cell survival and apoptosis, as well as a potential modulation of cytotoxic activity. This could be a mechanism to fine-tune the immune response, preventing excessive inflammation or tissue damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the findings suggest that IgG interactions with NK cells can lead to significant changes in gene expression, influencing key immunological pathways. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore the functional consequences of these gene expression changes in NK cell activity.\n",
