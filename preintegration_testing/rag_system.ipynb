Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\\nSummary::\\nIn 2023, 3651 Ohioans died because of an opioid overdose. Of those opioid overdoses, 3579 (98%) of which were attributed to fentanyl. We evaluated the association between 180 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and self-reported, nonfatal opioid overdose history from a prospective sample of 1301 adult patients (≥18 years of age) seen in three urban emergency departments in Ohio. Candidate SNPs included 120 related to the dopamine reward pathway and 60 related to pharmacokinetics. Of the 821 patients who reported having been exposed to opioids in their lifetime, 95 (11.6%) also reported having experienced an opioid-related overdose. Logistic regression, adjusting for age and biologic sex, was used to characterize the association between each SNP and opioid overdose, correcting for multiple comparisons. Three SNPs, located in three different genes were associated with opioid overdose: increased odds with CYP3A5 (rs776746) and DRD2 (rs4436578), and decreased odds with NKIR (rs6715729). Homozygotic CYP3A5 (rs776746) had the highest adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 6.96 (95% CI [2.45, 29.23]) and homozygotic NK1R (rs6715729) had the lowest OR of 0.28 (95% CI [0.14, 0.54). Given that CYP3A5 (rs776746) has been associated with increased plasma concentrations of fentanyl, rs776746 could potentially be utilized as a prognostic risk indicator for the potential of an opioid overdose. NK1R regulates the expression of the neurokinin-1 receptor, a regulator of respiration and NK1R (rs6715729) represents a novel genetic marker for a decreased risk of opioid overdose risk.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-07-28\\nTitle: Association between genetic polymorphisms in fibrinogen genes and bleeding risk in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants.\\nCopyright Information: \\n', name='pub_med', id='75c8b45a-6e79-4b12-b0b8-c81221dbd58b', tool_call_id='call_xqSXR5H0yghMWebgMwT3T5mz'),\n",

Experimental IgG, propose new mechanisms for why this causes genes to be upregulated and down regulated using other relevant aIMMUNOLOGY pathways found from the data provided.', 'context': [], 'answer': \"**Introduction**\\n\\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are critical components of the innate immune system, known for their ability to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. The regulation of gene expression in NK cells is crucial for their function and is influenced by various immunological pathways. This study aims to explore the differential gene expression in NK cells under experimental conditions involving IgG treatment, focusing on the upregulation and downregulation of specific genes and their potential roles in immunological pathways.\\n\\n**Methods**\\n\\nThe dataset provided includes gene expression data for NK cells, comparing control and experimental IgG conditions. The analysis focused on genes with significant log2 fold changes, indicating upregulation or downregulation. The genes were further analyzed for their involvement in known immunological pathways using literature review and pathway databases such as KEGG and Reactome. The statistical significance of gene expression changes was assessed using p-values and adjusted p-values (padj).\\n\\n**Results**\\n\\nThe analysis identified several genes with significant changes in expression. Notably, genes such as *Gzmd*, *Bcl2*, and *Klra9* were upregulated, while *Ifng*, *Tnfaip3*, and *Nfkbia* were downregulated. The upregulation of *Gzmd* suggests enhanced cytotoxic activity, as granzyme D is involved in inducing apoptosis in target cells (Pardo et al., 2009). The upregulation of *Bcl2* indicates increased cell survival, potentially enhancing NK cell longevity and function (Reed, 1998). The downregulation of *Ifng* and *Tnfaip3* suggests a suppression of inflammatory responses, as these genes are involved in cytokine production and NF-kB signaling, respectively (Schoenborn & Wilson, 2007; Wertz et al., 2004).\\n\\n**Discussion**\\n\\nThe differential expression of genes in NK cells under IgG treatment highlights potential mechanisms of immune modulation. The upregulation of cytotoxic and survival-related genes like *Gzmd* and *Bcl2* suggests that IgG may enhance NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and longevity, possibly through Fc receptor engagement and subsequent activation of signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt (Vivier et al., 2011). Conversely, the downregulation of *Ifng* and *Tnfaip3* indicates a potential dampening of pro-inflammatory responses, which could be beneficial in preventing excessive inflammation and tissue damage. This modulation may involve pathways such as the JAK/STAT and NF-kB pathways, which are known to regulate cytokine production and inflammatory responses (O'Shea & Plenge, 2012; Hayden & Ghosh, 2008).\\n\\nThe observed gene expression changes suggest that IgG treatment may fine-tune NK cell responses, enhancing their cytotoxic potential while limiting inflammatory damage. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise signaling mechanisms involved and to explore the therapeutic potential of modulating these pathways in diseases where NK cell activity is critical.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\n- Hayden, M.
